The goal is to improve your understanding and proficiency with SQL through practical examples and exercises.

## Sections

### 1. Basic SQL Commands
- **Data Retrieval**: Basic `SELECT` queries to view and filter data.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Using `ORDER BY`, `WHERE`, and conditional statements to filter and sort records.

### 3. Subqueries and Advanced Querying
- **Basic Subqueries**: Writing simple subqueries to filter and aggregate data.
- **Correlated Subqueries**: Advanced subqueries that reference outer queries for dynamic filtering.
- **Joins and Aggregations**: Combining data from multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and grouping.
